\usage{
animovement_install(..., only.missing = TRUE, install = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{comma-separated package names, quoted or unquoted, or vectors of package names. If left empty, all packages returned by \code{\link{animovement_packages}} are checked.}

\item{only.missing}{logical. \code{TRUE} only installs packages that are unavailable. \code{FALSE} installs all packages, even if they are available.}

\item{install}{logical. \code{TRUE} will proceed to install packages, whereas \code{FALSE} (recommended) will print the installation command asking you to run it in a clean R session.}
}
\value{
\code{animovement_install} returns \code{NULL} invisibly.
}
\description{
This function (by default) checks if any \emph{animovement} package is missing and installs the missing package(s).
}
\note{
There is also the possibility to set \code{options(animovement.install = TRUE)} before \code{library(animovement)}, which will call \code{animovement_install()} before loading any packages to make sure all packages are available.
If you are using a \code{.animovement} configuration file inside a project (see vignette), you can also place \code{_opt_animovement.install = TRUE} before the list of packages in that file.
